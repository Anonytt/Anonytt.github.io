  Hello! I am Yi Zheng(郑益). Welcome to my home page.
</p>
<p>
  I am a M.Eng student at <a herf="https://emwlab.fudan.edu.cn/">The Key Laboratory of Information Science of Electromagnetic Waves (MoE)</a>, Fudan University, supervised by Prof.<a href="http://www.it.fudan.edu.cn/Data/View/3966">  Niutao Liu </a>.<br>
<p>
<p>
  Prior to this, I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof.<a href="https://faculty.nwu.edu.cn/YudanRen/zh_CN/yjfx/81077/list/6"> Yudan Ren</a> and successfully received my B.Eng in Electronic Engineer in 2023 from Northwest University. 
<p>    
  My current research focus on Computer Graphics and Machine Learning, specifically in AI for Science. 
  I hope to explore new ways in mixed reality using AI as tool to improve human life and work efficiency.
